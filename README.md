# Valorant Instalock Tool
Valorant Instalock tool for selecting an agent to be instalocked before a match is found. 
- Created using Python, ttkbootstrap and valclient.

# Software Requirements:
- This software requires the use of additional modules. If you are only downloading the .py file then you can locate which modules were used at the top of the code.

# Software Information:
- This software allows you to Instalock an agent from a provided dropdown list of agents.
- An agent and region must be selected in order to proceed. 
- Please note that EU is set as the default region, however this can be changed at any time by selecting another within the dropdown list. 
- Regions are saved locally so it will store this data and automatically set your last used region in the instance of an application re-load.

# Important Notes
- Please ensure Valorant has fully loaded and at the main menu before attempting to instalock an agent.
- Try not to abuse this software, read below for further information. 
- If a new agent gets released and is therefore not on the dropdown menu then you can simply add the new agent to the agents.json file and
it will automatically populate the dropdown menu. Alternatively you can wait for me to provide a new release for the application and re-download, however, that
depends on if I'm still actively working on the project.

# Will using this get my account banned?
I suggest that you use this software at your own risk. Since this interacts with an API, using this tool for instalocking is against the
Riot's Terms of Service (ToS), however this should not be detected by vanguard anti-cheat since it does not interfere with any game
files or memory. If you're still concerned about the potential consequences then I recommend using this tool on an alternative account to therefore
avoid those risks, however that is completely up to you. 

# Installation:
The software can be downloaded from the releases section as a zip file. Once the zip file has been extracted just simply run the executable file.
